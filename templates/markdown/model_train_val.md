## TRAINING, VALIDATION AND TESTING THE MODEL
### TRAINING APPROACH  
The training approach is influenced by the following factors -  
1. Decision to solve the problem as a two-class classification supervised learning problem.  
2. Extremely skewed training data - 99.3% data belongs to class 0 and just 0.7% belongs to class 1.  
3. 150K + records available for training which include categorical features with high cardinality like EMPLOYER_NAME and SOC_TITLE, making a batch training approach more desirable.  
4. Training data available on the OFLC website in form of four quarterly files, each >50 Mb in size.
