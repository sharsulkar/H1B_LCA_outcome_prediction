# Project Description
### Targeted skills -

1. Multi-class classification problem on Unbalanced dataset
2. reusable and scalable pipeline that can be applied to all OFLC programs - Perm, H1B, H2A, H2B and Cw1  
3. Pyspark preprocessing and ML steps  
4. Airflow to run training pipeline for separate model per year/oflc program  
5. XAI for feature importance, explaining results for candidate cases and recommending most likely updates to feature values to change the outcome  
6. Streamlit+Heroku for showing EDA, model results and XAI
